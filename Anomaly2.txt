Today, I researched and planned the development of a fully automated AI-driven campaign management system using our existing CSV campaign data and Rainforest API for competitor insights. The key steps explored include:

1.  Data Collection & Integration:

    Reading our campaign CSV files containing bids, ACOS, impressions, sales, etc.
    Pulling competitor and market data via Rainforest API.
    Combining internal campaign data with external competitor snapshots to create a unified dataset.

2.  Transition from Rule-Based to ML-Based Approach:

    Instead of using IF-ELSE rules for decision making, we explored building a machine learning decision engine.
    Features are engineered from campaign performance trends (ACOS changes, sales trends, CPC spikes) and competitor metrics (price gaps, sponsored listings, competition intensity).
    The trained ML model can predict optimal actions (Increase Bid / Decrease Bid / No Change) based on patterns in combined internal and external data.

3.  Automation Workflow:

    Data input → Feature Engineering → ML Model Prediction → Recommendation Generation → Export New CSV / Reports.
    This pipeline can run automatically on a schedule, providing actionable bid adjustments and insights without manual intervention.

4.  Next Steps & Scalability:

    Prototype the ML model using static CSV data.
    Once validated, extend the system to handle live campaign data for fully dynamic automation.
    Explore continuous learning and feedback loops to improve model accuracy over time.
