Amazon Ads Anomaly Detection

1️ Purpose:
- Automatically detect unexpected changes in campaign, keyword, or ASIN performance.
- Protect ad spend and business health before visible damage occurs.
- Complement bid optimization: constraints handle known rules; anomaly detection handles unknown/early problems.

2️ Business Value:
- Early warning for ACOS spike, CVR drop, inventory issues, spend leaks, or conversion crashes.
- Prevents loss even when bid optimization constraints (like ACOS target, inventory limit) are in place.
- Helps detect issues like competitor pricing, listing problems, buy box loss, or traffic anomalies before profit impact.

3️ Key Concept:
- Bid Optimization: Maintains performance according to set rules/constraints.
- Anomaly Detection: Monitors behaviour and flags abnormal patterns before rules are triggered.

4️ Minimum Required Features / Columns:

Model Input Features (for ML / statistical model):
- impressions
- clicks
- spend
- sales
- orders
- ctr
- cpc
- cvr
- acos
- roas
- bid
- inventory_level
- stock_out_flag
- organic_rank
- impressions_change_1d
- clicks_change_1d
- spend_change_1d
- sales_change_1d
- orders_change_1d
- ctr_change_1d
- cvr_change_1d
- acos_change_1d
- ctr_7d_avg
- cvr_7d_avg
- acos_7d_avg
- spend_7d_avg
- sales_7d_avg

Notes:
- ID columns (campaign_id, ad_group_id, keyword, asin) are NOT used as input to the model, but kept in the dataset for tracking.
- Time columns like date/day_of_week can be used for rolling metrics but not as direct model input.

5️ Feature Types:
- Performance Metrics: impressions, clicks, sales, ACOS, CVR etc.
- Behaviour Change Metrics: day-over-day changes like sales_change_1d.
- Stability Metrics: 7-day rolling averages like cvr_7d_avg.
- Inventory / Organic Signals: inventory_level, stock_out_flag, organic_rank.

6️ Model Type:
- Unsupervised or statistical:
   - Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders
   - Or simple rule-based thresholds for small-scale systems
- Goal: Detect abnormal behaviour patterns, not predict a target.

7️ Key Takeaways:
- Even if bid optimization constraints are in place (like ACOS limit or inventory rule), anomaly detection is needed to catch **hidden or early-stage problems**.
- Detects early signs of profit loss, market shifts, conversion drops, or traffic anomalies before ACOS or other KPIs visibly fail.
- Complements bid optimization – protects business health, not just enforces rules.

8️ Analogy:
- Bid Optimization = Cruise Control (maintains speed/performance)
- Anomaly Detection = Smoke Detector (alerts before problem becomes critical)
